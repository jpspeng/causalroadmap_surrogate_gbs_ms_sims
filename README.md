# Simulation code for Gilbert et al., 2024

This repository contains code for "A Surrogate Endpoint Based Provisional Approval Causal Roadmap" by 
Gilbert et al., 2024. 

All code is inside the `ms_sim.R` file. Most of the code consists of helper functions. The last section "Some Sample
Code to Try" has a few lines of code to generate simulated datasets, run the estimators, obtain bootstrap and sandwich 
standard errors, and run a single simulation.

If you would like to get in touch about this code, please email jpspeng@uw.edu.
